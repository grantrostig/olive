  <h5>Don't spin the wheel...</h5>
  <p>Test your understanding of your users, the problems they face, and your solution. The earlier you test your assumptions,
  the less time (and money) you'll spent designing and building the wrong product.</p>
  <p>On this wheel are some common questions that users can help answer. </p>
  <p>Click on any question to see how to get answers.</p>
  <p>You can use the arrow keys (up/down) to cycle through the wheel, as well as the space bar just to let it spin (and stop).</p>
  <h5>Colors</h5>
  <p>The darker the color, the earlier it can be answered. In this model there are three phases:</p>
  <ol>
    <li class="requirements">before</li>
    <li class="design">design & build</li>
    <li class="test">after</li>
  </ol>
  <p>"Before" is all the activities done before you a ready to build the product-- mostly understanding the user and problems. 
    "After" are activities around improving a working product.</p>
